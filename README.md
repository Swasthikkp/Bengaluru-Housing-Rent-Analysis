# Bengaluru Housing Rent & Price Analysis

## Project Overview
This fresher-level project explores rental patterns in Bengaluru using a dataset of house rents. It focuses on affordability, BHK-wise pricing, location-based rent differences, and furnishing impact. The goal is to practice core data analytics skills with Python, SQL, and Excel.

## Project Structure
- data/BangaloreHouseRentDtls_clean.csv  - cleaned dataset
- Bengaluru_Housing_Analysis.ipynb       - Jupyter notebook with EDA and mini-report
- figures/                              - generated charts (rent_by_bhk.png, rent_distribution_by_area.png)
